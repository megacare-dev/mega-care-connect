## Overview

Mega Care Connect is a simple LINE Front-end Framework (LIFF) application  designed to demonstrate a complete CI/CD workflow. This application authenticates users, displays their LINE profile information, and is automatically deployed to Google Cloud Run from GitHub using Google Cloud Build.

This project serves as a foundational template for creating, containerizing, and deploying modern serverless web applications integrated with the LINE platform.

## Data Structure
# Firestore Data Structure for CPAP Customer Management

This document outlines the data structure used in Firestore to store customer information, their CPAP devices, and daily reports. The structure is designed to be scalable and query-efficient.

## Data Hierarchy

The database follows a hierarchical model with a main root collection and several nested sub-collections.

customers/{patientId}├── devices/{deviceId}├── masks/{maskId}├── airTubing/{tubingId}└── dailyReports/{reportDate}
---

## 1. Root Collection: `customers`

This is the main collection where each document represents a single patient. The document ID is the unique `patientId`.

-   **Collection:** `customers`
-   **Document ID:** `patient_id` (e.g., `ee319d58-9aeb-4af7-b156-f91540689595`)
